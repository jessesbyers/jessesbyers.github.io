*I created Watershed Monitor to fill a real environmental need. We currently have the science we need to make the needed changes to protect our water quality, and we have many laws and regulations at every level related to managing and protecting our quality. However, most government agencies and organizations lack the capacity to effectively monitor and enforce these regulations and support best practices. This application aims to help reduce this capacity problem. By calling on the public to collect and report data on water quality, the data can be used to help agencies and organizations prioritize their enforcement and support where it is most needed.*
